## Usage

As a user, you can see a snapshot of your current work day with the current date. The application breaks down your work day into hour time slots, where the user can enter specific information needed to complete by that time. The application will depict the current hour in red, past hours in grey, and future hours in green, to quickly let the user know where he/she is in the work day. Any text entered will be saved for that time slot.
